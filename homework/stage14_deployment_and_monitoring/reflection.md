Subject: Monitoring Plan for the Volume-Price Analysis Conclusion


The conclusion that trading volume is not a reliable predictor of short-term price movements for the DJIA is a valuable insight. However, deploying this conclusion as a strategic rule ("do not use daily volume for trading decisions") carries its own risks. The primary risk is a market regime change, where the underlying market dynamics shift, and a relationship between volume and price begins to emerge. If we aren't monitoring for this, our "do-nothing" conclusion could lead to missed opportunities.

To ensure our conclusion remains valid over time, we would monitor the analysis across four layers.

Data Layer: We would monitor the data feed freshness from the Yahoo Finance source, alerting if data is more than 24 hours old. We would also track the completeness of the data, alerting if the null rate for Volume or Adj Close exceeds 1%, as this could corrupt the analysis.

Analysis Layer: Instead of model accuracy, we would monitor the core statistical finding of the analysis itself. We would automatically re-run the regression analysis weekly and track the 90-day rolling R-squared value. An alert would be triggered if the R-squared value rises above 0.05, signaling that volume is starting to explain more of the price variance and the original conclusion may no longer hold.

System Layer: Weâ€™d monitor the health of the automated analysis script itself. Key metrics would be the job success rate (alert if < 99%) and the script execution time (alert if it deviates by more than 50%), which could indicate system or data source issues.

Business Layer: The key business metric is ensuring that no significant, volume-driven trading opportunities are being missed. This would be monitored by having financial analysts conduct a quarterly qualitative review to see if new market chatter or observed patterns contradict our findings.

Ownership for this monitoring process would fall to the Financial Analyst or Research team. System-level alerts would route to a Data Engineering on-call, while an R-squared alert would create a ticket for an analyst to investigate immediately. The conclusion's validity would be formally re-evaluated every quarter to decide if the analysis needs to be updated or expanded.
