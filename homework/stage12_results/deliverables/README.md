# Stage 12 Deliverable

## Audience and Rationale

* **Chosen Audience**: A senior management team or investment committee.
* **Chosen Format**: A 5-slide presentation deck.

## Why this format fits their needs:

The slide deck format was chosen because this audience is time-constrained and needs to make a strategic decision quickly. This format focuses on:
* **Brevity**: Key takeaways are presented upfront in an executive summary.
* **Clarity**: Visual charts are used to explain complex tradeoffs like risk vs. return.
* **Action-Oriented Language**: The final slide provides clear, actionable next steps, guiding the decision-making process.
